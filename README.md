## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop a web application using Streamlit to detect the breed of pets (cats and dogs). The model is trained on a dataset of over 37 breeds of cats and dogs. The web application has three options:

1. **Upload:** Users can upload an image of a pet and the model will predict the breed of the pet in real time. The model will also display the top 5 classes with the highest probability, along with the predicted class being the first.
2. **Capture:** Users can capture an image of a pet using their camera and the model will predict the breed of the pet in real time.
3. **Model:** This option displays the performance of the model on the training data, the data preprocessing pipeline, and the model summary.

The web application is hosted and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. The model is deployed using Streamlit, which is a Python framework for building and sharing data apps.

This project is useful for pet owners who want to identify the breed of their pet. It can also be used by animal shelters to help identify the breeds of animals in their care.

## 2. Data
The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset is a dataset of 37 categories of pets, with roughly 200 images for each class. The images have a large variation in scale, pose, and lighting. All images have an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head ROI, and pixel level trimap segmentation.

The dataset is available for download via BitTorrent or HTTP. The dataset and annotations are roughly 800 MB in size.

The following annotations are available for every image in the dataset:

* Species and breed name
* A tight bounding box (ROI) around the head of the animal
* A pixel level foreground-background segmentation (Trimap)

The dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

**Data Pre-processing Pipeline**

```python
IntToFloatTensor -- {'div': 255.0, 
                    'div_mask': 1} -> 
Flip -- {'size': 224, 
         'mode': 'bilinear', 
         'pad_mode': 'reflection', 
         'mode_mask': 'nearest', 
         'align_corners': True, 
         'p': 0.5} -> 
Brightness -- {'max_lighting': 0.2, 'p': 1.0, 
               'draw': None, 
               'batch': False} -> 
Normalize -- {'mean': tensor([[[[0.4850]],[[0.4560]],[[0.4060]]]]), 
              'std': tensor([[[[0.2290]],[[0.2240]],[[0.2250]]]]), 
              'axes': (0, 2, 3)}
```

* **IntToFloatTensor:** Normalizes pixel values by dividing by 255.0. **Why:** This is necessary because Deep Learning models typically expect floating-point input.
* **Flip:** Horizontally flips images with a probability of 0.5. **Why:** This helps to augment the dataset and make the model more robust to variations in the data.
* **Brightness:** Changes the brightness of images by up to 20%. **Why:** This helps to augment the dataset and make the model more robust to variations in the lighting conditions.
* **Normalize:** Normalizes pixel values using the mean and standard deviation of the ImageNet dataset. **Why:** This helps to improve the performance of the model by making the pixel values more consistent across different images.

## 3. Model

The selected model is a convolutional neural network (CNN), an ideal architecture for image classification tasks. This CNN comprises 17 convolutional layers, followed by a global average pooling layer, and culminates in a fully connected layer with 37 outputs.

**Input Layer:**
- The input layer accepts images with dimensions of 224x224 pixels and 3 color channels (64 x 3 x 224 x 224).
- It serves as the entry point for image data into the network.

**Convolutional Layers:**
- These 17 layers are responsible for extracting salient features from the input images.
- The convolutional layers employ learned filters to highlight relevant patterns.
- As the network deepens, the filters become increasingly complex, capturing intricate image details.

**Global Average Pooling Layer:**
- Following the convolutional layers, the global average pooling layer takes the extracted features.
- It computes the average of these features, reducing their spatial dimensions.
- This step enhances the network's robustness to image translations and rotations.

**Fully Connected Layer (Output Layer):**
- The final layer is a fully connected output layer with 37 units.
- It corresponds to the 37 classes you aim to classify your input data into.
- The output layer produces a probability distribution across these 37 classes.

**Activation Functions:**
- All convolutional layers utilize the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function.
- ReLU transforms negative inputs to zero while preserving positive values.
- This choice enhances the network's expressiveness and aids in mitigating overfitting.

**Loss Function:**
- The loss function used is the cross-entropy loss.
- Cross-entropy measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution (ground truth).
- It guides the model during training to predict the correct probability distribution over the 37 classes for each input image.

**Model Parameters:**
- Total Parameters: 25,633,344
- Total Trainable Parameters: 2,178,432
- Total Non-Trainable Parameters: 23,454,912

**Optimizer and Training Details:**
- Optimizer Used: Adam optimizer
- Loss Function: FlattenedLoss of CrossEntropyLoss()

**Model Training:**
- Model frozen up to parameter group #2 during training.
- Callbacks:
  - TrainEvalCallback
  - CastToTensor
  - MixedPrecision
  - Recorder
  - ProgressCallback

**Why this Model Architecture?**
- This model architecture is chosen for its demonstrated effectiveness in image classification tasks.
- The abundant convolutional layers enable the extraction of intricate features.
- The global average pooling layer contributes to translation and rotation invariance.
- The fully connected output layer empowers the network to discern complex relationships between features and the 37 target classes.

In summary, this architecture balances the depth of feature extraction, spatial invariance, and classification capabilities, making it a robust choice for image classification tasks with 37 classes, with a clear input and output layer structure, along with detailed training information.

2. The model was trained on the training dataset for 10 epochs.
3. The model was evaluated on the validation dataset after each epoch.
4. The model was saved after the epoch with the best validation accuracy.

**Performance with frozen layers**

The model with frozen layers achieved a validation accuracy of 93.64% after 10 epochs.

**Performance with unfrozen layers**

The model with unfrozen layers achieved a validation accuracy of 93.78% after 10 epochs.

**Conclusion**

The model with unfrozen layers achieved a slightly better validation accuracy than the model with frozen layers. This suggests that fine-tuning the parameters of the ResNet50 model can improve the performance of the model on the specific task of pet breed detection.

## 5. Evaluation:

The performance of the model was evaluated on the validation dataset using the following metrics:

* Accuracy: The percentage of images that are correctly classified by the model.
* Precision: The percentage of images that are classified as a particular breed that are actually of that breed.
* Recall: The percentage of images of a particular breed that are correctly classified by the model.

The model achieved the following results on the validation dataset:

| Metric | ResNet50 (frozen layers) | ResNet50 (unfrozen layers) |

## 6. Deployment: This section should describe how you deployed your model to production.

## Project Overview
---
This deep learning project presents a sophisticated Cat & Dog breed detector built using the advanced Fastai framework. Our objective was to accurately classify pet images into 37 distinct categories, representing various breeds. To achieve this, we utilized the challenging Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, known for its diverse pet images with complex variations in scale, pose, and lighting.

## Fastai Computer Vision Pipeline for Cat & Dog Breed Detection
---

### 1. Data Loading
---
- We focused on the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/), renowned for its 37 distinct pet categories and high-quality images.
- Essential libraries, including FastAi 2.7.12, were imported to support this computer vision project.
- The FastAi vision package was imported to leverage its modules and functions for computer vision tasks.
- We employed the `get_image_files` function to retrieve image file paths.
- The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset was downloaded and untarred from the provided URL.
- A list of image file names within the 'images' directory of the dataset was obtained using the `get_image_files` function.
- We displayed the total image count in the dataset, which stands at 7390 images.
- Additionally, we showcased the file paths of the first 10 images in the dataset, offering insights into the data's structure and location.

### 2. Data Preparation
---
- **Statistical Normalization**: Importing critical statistics from FastAi's `imagenet_stats` for image data normalization.
- **Image Augmentation and Cropping**: Incorporating essential image transformation functions like `aug_transforms` and `RandomResizedCrop` from FastAi to introduce variability and robustness into the dataset.
- **Item Transforms**: Defining `item_tfms` to specify item-level transformations, including random resized crops with dimensions of 460 pixels, enhancing dataset diversity.
- **Batch Transforms**: Creating a list of batch-level transformations, denoted as `batch_tfms`, to apply operations such as resizing to 224 pixels, maximum warping, and data normalization using `imagenet_stats`.

These meticulous data preparation steps ensure that the dataset is appropriately conditioned for subsequent phases of the computer vision pipeline, setting the stage for successful model training, validation, and evaluation.

### 3. Creating Data Loaders
---
- **DataBlock Definition**: Establishing a DataBlock named 'pets' to orchestrate data processing. It defines key aspects, including data blocks (Image and Category), image file acquisition, random data splitting into training and validation sets, and category label extraction from file names using regular expressions.
- **Item-Level and Batch-Level Transformations**: Configuring `item_tfms` and `batch_tfms` within the DataBlock to ensure consistent preprocessing of each image and batch for model readiness.
- **Data Loaders Creation**: Creating data loaders ('dls') using the 'pets' DataBlock for efficient data loading and batching. The training dataset ('dls.train_ds') contains 5912 images, while the validation dataset ('dls.valid_ds') contains 1478 images, both spanning 37 distinct pet breeds. A batch size of 64 was specified for data loaders.
- **Data Set Overview**: Providing a sneak peek into the training and validation datasets by displaying a sample of their elements, consisting of PIL images and corresponding category labels. Additionally, revealing the 37 distinct pet breed classes.

### 4. Defining Learner (Model) & Learning Rate
---
### 4. Defining Learner (Model) & Learning Rate
---
- **Transfer Learning with Pretrained Model**: Leveraging the power of transfer learning, we started with a pretrained model as the foundation of our Cat & Dog breed detector. Specifically, we used a ResNet-50 architecture that had been pretrained on the vast ImageNet dataset. This pretrained model had already learned to recognize a wide range of low-level features, such as edges, textures, and basic shapes, making it a valuable starting point for our specific task.

- **Mixed-Precision Training**: To optimize training efficiency, we employed mixed-precision training techniques using FastAi's `to_fp16()` method. This allowed us to use lower-precision data types during training, reducing memory consumption and speeding up the training process while maintaining model accuracy.

- **Model Architecture**: Our learner (model) was instantiated with key parameters, including data loaders ('dls'), the ResNet-50 architecture ('arch=resnet50'), and the utilization of a pretrained model ('pretrained=True'). This pretrained model served as a feature extractor, preserving the knowledge it had gained from ImageNet.

- **Fine-Tuning the Top Layers**: While the initial layers of the pretrained model were frozen (kept fixed), the top layers, responsible for higher-level feature extraction and classification, were trainable. This allowed our model to adapt its learned features to the specific task of classifying pet breeds.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: To assess the model's performance, we equipped the learner with evaluation metrics, including accuracy and error rate.

- **Learning Rate Finder**: To determine the optimal learning rate for our fine-tuning process, we used the `learn.lr_find()` method. The reported learning rate range, `slice(0.0001, 0.01, None)`, provided a suitable range for adaptive learning rate adjustments during training.

These steps lay the foundation for our Cat & Dog breed detector, incorporating transfer learning to capitalize on the knowledge acquired by the pretrained model and adapt it to the nuances of pet breed classification.
