## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop a web application using Streamlit to detect the breed of pets (cats and dogs). The model is trained on a dataset of over 37 breeds of cats and dogs. The web application has three options:

1. **Upload:** Users can upload an image of a pet and the model will predict the breed of the pet in real time. The model will also display the top 5 classes with the highest probability, along with the predicted class being the first.
2. **Capture:** Users can capture an image of a pet using their camera and the model will predict the breed of the pet in real time.
3. **Model:** This option displays the performance of the model on the training data, the data preprocessing pipeline, and the model summary.

The web application is hosted and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. The model is deployed using Streamlit, which is a Python framework for building and sharing data apps.

This project is useful for pet owners who want to identify the breed of their pet. It can also be used by animal shelters to help identify the breeds of animals in their care.

## 2. Data
The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset is a dataset of 37 categories of pets, with roughly 200 images for each class. The images have a large variation in scale, pose, and lighting. All images have an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head ROI, and pixel level trimap segmentation.

The dataset is available for download via BitTorrent or HTTP. The dataset and annotations are roughly 800 MB in size.

The following annotations are available for every image in the dataset:

* Species and breed name
* A tight bounding box (ROI) around the head of the animal
* A pixel level foreground-background segmentation (Trimap)

The dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

**Data Pre-processing Pipeline**

```python
IntToFloatTensor -- {'div': 255.0, 
                    'div_mask': 1} -> 
Flip -- {'size': 224, 
         'mode': 'bilinear', 
         'pad_mode': 'reflection', 
         'mode_mask': 'nearest', 
         'align_corners': True, 
         'p': 0.5} -> 
Brightness -- {'max_lighting': 0.2, 'p': 1.0, 
               'draw': None, 
               'batch': False} -> 
Normalize -- {'mean': tensor([[[[0.4850]],[[0.4560]],[[0.4060]]]]), 
              'std': tensor([[[[0.2290]],[[0.2240]],[[0.2250]]]]), 
              'axes': (0, 2, 3)}
```

* **IntToFloatTensor:** Normalizes pixel values by dividing by 255.0. **Why:** This is necessary because Deep Learning models typically expect floating-point input.
* **Flip:** Horizontally flips images with a probability of 0.5. **Why:** This helps to augment the dataset and make the model more robust to variations in the data.
* **Brightness:** Changes the brightness of images by up to 20%. **Why:** This helps to augment the dataset and make the model more robust to variations in the lighting conditions.
* **Normalize:** Normalizes pixel values using the mean and standard deviation of the ImageNet dataset. **Why:** This helps to improve the performance of the model by making the pixel values more consistent across different images.

## 3. Model Architecture

The Pets (Cats and Dogs) Breed Detector employs a sophisticated convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed to excel in the challenging task of classifying images into 37 distinct breeds of cats and dogs. This section provides a detailed exploration of the model's architecture, emphasizing its key components and capabilities.

### Input Shape

The model expects input images to be provided in batches of 64, with each image having 3 color channels (representing RGB) and a spatial resolution of 224 x 224 pixels.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The core of the Pets Breed Detector is a robust CNN, consisting of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activation functions. This CNN architecture is tailored to capture intricate features within cat and dog images.

#### Feature Extraction

The initial layers of the network focus on feature extraction:

- **Convolutional Layers**: The model commences with convolutional layers that learn to extract low-level features from the input images. These layers are equipped with a total of 9,408 trainable parameters, enhancing feature representation.

- **Batch Normalization**: After each convolutional layer, batch normalization is applied, contributing to network stability and accelerated training.

- **ReLU Activation**: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions follow batch normalization, introducing non-linearity to the network and enabling it to recognize complex patterns within the data.

#### Spatial Reduction

To reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and abstract information, max-pooling layers are utilized:

- **MaxPooling Layers**: These layers effectively reduce the spatial resolution by half, downsizing the feature maps.

#### Feature Enrichment

The model includes additional convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activation functions to enrich feature representation:

- **Convolutional Layers with Batch Normalization and ReLU**: Multiple sets of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activation functions are applied. Each set employs an increasing number of filters, progressively enhancing feature representation by capturing intricate patterns and structures in the images.

#### Transition to Fully Connected Layers

After feature extraction and enrichment, the model shifts from convolutional layers to fully connected layers for classification:

- **Flattening**: The 2D feature maps are flattened into a 1D vector, preparing the data for fully connected layers.

- **Batch Normalization and Dropout**: Batch normalization and dropout techniques are applied to enhance generalization and reduce overfitting.

#### Fully Connected Layers

The fully connected layers are responsible for making predictions and classifying the input images:

- **Linear Layers**: The final fully connected layers consist of a hidden layer with 512 neurons, followed by an output layer with 37 neurons. These layers are well-suited for the multi-class classification task, where the model distinguishes between 37 different breeds of cats and dogs.

- **ReLU Activation**: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions are employed to introduce non-linearity, ensuring the model can capture intricate relationships between features.
